            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Jesus' life:</h3>
            <li><strong>Early life</strong> - Jesus' childhood home is identified in the gospels of Luke and Matthew as the town of Nazareth in Galilee, where he lived with his family.</li>
            <li><strong>Baptism</strong> - In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and as he comes out of the water he sees the Holy Spirit descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God's Son.</li>
            <li><strong>Temptation</strong> - Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness (Matthew 4:3–11). In Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying
              (Luke
              3:21–22). John implicitly recognizes Jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him (Luke 7:18–23). Jesus' baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public ministry.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Ministry</strong> - The Synoptics depict two distinct geographical settings in Jesus' ministry. The first takes place north of Judea, in Galilee, where Jesus conducts a successful ministry; and the second shows Jesus
              rejected and killed when he travels to Jerusalem. Often referred to as "rabbi", Jesus preaches his message orally. Notably, Jesus forbids those who recognize him as the Messiah to speak of it, including people he heals and demons he
              exorcises.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Disciples and followers - Near the beginning of his ministry, Jesus appoints twelve apostles. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus' first four apostles, who were fishermen, are
                described
                as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so.</li>
              <li>Teachings and miracles - In the Synoptics, Jesus teaches extensively, often in parables, about the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom is described as both imminent (Mark 1:15) and already present in the ministry of Jesus (Luke 17:21).
                Jesus
                promises inclusion in the Kingdom for those who accept his message (Mark 10:13–27). Jesus talks of the "Son of Man," an apocalyptic figure who would come to gather the chosen.</li>
              <li>Proclamation as Christ - Peter tells Jesus, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." Jesus affirms that Peter's confession is divinely revealed truth. After the confession, Jesus tells his disciples about his upcoming
                death
                and resurrection (Matthew 16:21, Mark 8:31, Luke 9:22)</li>
              <li>Transfiguration - Jesus takes Peter and two other apostles up an unnamed mountain, where "he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white." A bright cloud appears around them,
                and a voice from the cloud says, "This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him" (Matthew 17:1–9).</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Passion</strong> - The description of the last week of the life of Jesus (often called Passion Week) occupies about one third of the narrative in the canonical gospels, starting with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem and
              ending with his Crucifixion.</li>
            <li><strong>Resurrection</strong> - Mary Magdalene (alone in the Gospel of John, but accompanied by other women in the Synoptics) goes to Jesus' tomb on Sunday morning and is surprised to find it empty. Despite Jesus' teaching, the
              disciples
              had not understood that Jesus would rise again.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"There was much else that Jesus did; if it were written down in detail, I do not suppose the world itself would hold all the books that would be written."</p>
